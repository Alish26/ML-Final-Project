# Drowsiness Alert System
Currently, driver drowsiness is a major element in accidents and vehicle accidents in the world. Although there are many approaches, all of them are either trained models for all eye and mouth imaging features, as a result, their accuracy has decreased or they define sleepiness of the driver by selecting only one function, which is not applicable in a real situation.  
We came up with a solution, that is, we took into account a feature called Eye Aspect Ratio. This project's dataset served as the UTA real-life sleepiness dataset[1]. This project can be divided into 3 parts:<br>
Data Collection and Feature Extraction<br>
Build Convolutional Neural Network Model<br>
Evaluate the model based on different Evaluation Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity<br>
